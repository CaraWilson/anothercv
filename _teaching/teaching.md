### CoastWatch Satellite Course

In 2006, I established the [CoastWatch Satellite Course](https://coastwatch-training.github.io/), designed to expose NOAA Fisheries' scientists to satellite data and help them **integrate** satellite data into their workflows. 

Since its inception, the course has been held regularly and adapted for specific topics like sea ice and animal telemetry data. Originally taught in-person, these courses moved to an online format during COVID-19, which remains the primary delivery method today. All materials are available on the [Course Website](https://coastwatch-training.github.io/).
